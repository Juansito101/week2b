hello world

print("Loading...", end="", flush=True)
time.sleep(3)
print(" Done!")



hello world

print("Loading...", end="")
time.sleep(3)
print(" Done!")





by default flush=flush and if i wanted to overright the default output then I would use flush=True.

Python forces the output buffer to write to the screen.


flush=False default (does not force immediate output)

flush=True (forces immediate output) (trigers the flush)





e.

The argument that triggers the flush is flush=True
or the newline (\n) in line-buffered mode

is

 what triggers the flush is print() 

flush=True    (explicit trigger)
end="\n"   indirecly triggers it in line- bufered environments
